## Label Encoding for Neural Networks

### Overview
In the data preparation phase for neural network input, categorical class labels undergo encoding using the scikit-learn `LabelEncoder`. This step is crucial for ensuring the neural network processes numerical data consistently and efficiently.

### Process
1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   encoder = LabelEncoder()
The `LabelEncoder` is initialized to handle the encoding process.

2. **Learning Mapping:**
   ```python
   encoder.fit(Y)
The `fit()` method is employed to learn the mapping between unique class labels in Y and corresponding numerical values.  

3. **Transformation:**
   ```python
   encoded_Y = encoder.transform(Y)
   The `transform()` method is applied to convert the original categorical class labels into numerical values based on the learned mapping.

## Creating a Neural Network Model: 
we are about to build a neural network using Keras, which is a popular deep learning library. 
the initial model is relatively simple, with a single hidden layer containing neurons equal to the number of input variables. 

- **Weight Initialization:** The model's weights are initialized using small Gaussian random numbers.
- **Activation Function:** The rectifier activation function is used in the hidden layer. it introduces the non-linearity to the model (to learn complex patterns in data).
- **Output layer:** The output layer has a single neuron, uses the sigmoid function, produces probability between 0 and 1.
- **Loss function:** During training, the model uses the lograritmic loss function
- **Optimization Algorithm:** The model uses the efficient **Adam optimization algorithm** for gradient descent, which can accelerate the **convergence of the model**.
- **Performance Metrics:** The model collects metricsduring training, which tell us how well the model is performing.

## Training Using Stratified k-fold Cross Validation:
In the evaluation process, scikit-learn employs stratified k-fold cross-validation. This technique partitions the data into k subsets, trains the model on k-1 subsets, and evaluates on the remaining subset. This cycle repeats k times, calculating the average performance. The term 'stratified' indicates that each split maintains a balanced representation of each class, effectively addressing potential imbalances within the dataset.

## Integrating Keras with scikit-learn:
Using the KerasClassifier wrapper from SciKeras, you seamlessly incorporate Keras neural network models into scikit-learn. This facilitates the combined strengths of both libraries for effective model training and evaluation.

## Baseline Model

### Overview
The baseline model serves as a starting point for your neural network. It's a simple feedforward model built using the Keras library with a focus on binary classification.

### Model Architecture
1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   model = Sequential()
Initializes a sequential model, representing a linear stack of layers.

2. **Hidden Layer:**
   ```python
   model.add(Dense(60, input_shape=(60,), activation='relu'))
Adds a fully connected hidden layer with 60 neurons. The input_shape parameter defines the 1D array shape of the input data (60 features). The ReLU activation introduces non-linearity.

3. **Output Layer:**
   ```python
   model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
Adds the output layer with a single neuron, suitable for binary classification. Sigmoid activation produces a probability output between 0 and 1.

4. **Model Compilation:**
   ```python
   model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
Configures the model for training with binary crossentropy loss, Adam optimizer, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
